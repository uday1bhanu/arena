# Scenario-3: Multi-Agent Product Investigation & Recommendation

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete, Ready for Testing
**Created**: March 13, 2026
**Test Case**: T5

---

## Overview

Scenario-3 introduces **multi-agent collaboration** where specialized sub-agents work together to handle a complex customer request involving product recommendations, refund status, spending analysis, and discount calculations.

This scenario tests:
- **Agent orchestration**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents
- **Context sharing**: Passing information between agents efficiently
- **Tool efficiency**: Avoiding redundant API calls across agents
- **Response synthesis**: Combining insights from multiple agents coherently
- **Complex decision-making**: Balancing budget, preferences, and constraints

## Test Case: T5

### Customer Request

```
Hi, this is customer CUST-001. I'm looking to upgrade my home office setup.
I recently had issues with my laptop #ORD-1234, and I'm wondering:

1. What's the status of my refund?
2. Can you recommend a better laptop model based on my purchase history?
3. I also need a good monitor and keyboard to go with it
4. What's my total spending this year and do I qualify for any discounts?

I want reliable products and I'm willing to spend up to $3000 total.
Can you help me put together a complete setup?
```

### Expected Workflow

**Phase 1 - Research Agent**:
1. Get customer profile (CUST-001)
2. Retrieve order history
3. Search KB: refund policy
4. Search KB: laptop recommendations
5. Search KB: premium benefits
6. Get product catalog: laptops
7. Get product catalog: monitors
8. Get product catalog: keyboards

**Phase 2 - Analysis Agent**:
1. Confirm refund status for ORD-1234
2. Calculate YTD spending
3. Evaluate laptop options (considering previous issue)
4. Select complementary monitor + keyboard
5. Calculate total cost
6. Apply discount calculation
7. Verify within $3000 budget

**Phase 3 - Communication Agent**:
1. Address all 4 questions
2. Present recommendations with justifications
3. Show pricing breakdown with discounts
4. Provide next steps

## Next Steps

1. **Start MCP Server V2**: `python -m arena.mcp_server_v2`
2. **Run Iteration 1**: `python scripts/run_scenario3.py 1`
3. **Analyze Results**: Review correctness scores and agent coordination
4. **Run Iteration 2**: Test reproducibility
5. **Compare with Scenario-1/2**: How do multi-agent systems perform vs single agents?

## Research Questions

1. **Do multi-agent systems outperform single agents on complex tasks?**
2. **Which orchestration pattern is most effective? (sequential, parallel, hierarchical)**
3. **How much overhead does agent coordination introduce?**
4. **Are tool calls distributed efficiently across agents?**
5. **Does context get lost when passing between agents?**
