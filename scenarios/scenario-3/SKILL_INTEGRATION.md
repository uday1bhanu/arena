# Multi-Agent Skill Integration for Scenario-3 (T5)

**Date**: March 13, 2026
**Status**: ✅ Integrated and Ready

---

## Overview

Instead of implementing custom multi-agent orchestration code, Scenario-3 (T5) now uses a **Claude skill** that Claude automatically invokes when appropriate.

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Installation

The skill is installed at:
```
/Users/ukanagala/.claude/skills/multi-agent-product-investigation/
```

Claude Agent SDK automatically detects skills in this directory.

### 2. Automatic Triggering

When Claude receives a T5 scenario prompt (which involves multiple questions about refunds, products, discounts, and budget), the skill's description matches and Claude automatically invokes it.

**Skill Description** (from SKILL.md):
> Handle complex multi-faceted customer inquiries involving product recommendations, refund status, discount calculations, and budget optimization. Use this skill when a customer has 2+ interrelated questions...

### 3. Framework Integration

**File**: `arena/frameworks/claude_sdk_agent.py`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated MCP server from `mcp_server.py` → `mcp_server_v2.py`
- This provides access to extended tools: `get_product_catalog`, `calculate_discount`, `check_inventory`
- No other changes needed - Claude Agent SDK handles skill access automatically

**Removed**:
- `arena/frameworks/claude_sdk_multiagent.py` (no longer needed)

### 4. Running T5 with the Skill

```bash
# Use the existing test runner - no changes needed
python scripts/run_scenario3.py 1
```

When the scenario runs:
1. Claude Agent SDK starts with `claude_sdk_agent.py`
2. Claude sees the T5 prompt (multiple interrelated questions)
3. Claude's skill description matcher triggers `multi-agent-product-investigation`
4. The skill coordinates research, analysis, and communication phases
5. Claude uses MCP tools (from mcp_server_v2) to get real data
6. Final response addresses all customer questions with specific recommendations

## Skill Performance

Based on evaluation (3 test cases, 21 assertions total):

| Metric | With Skill | Without Skill | Delta |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Correctness** | 100% (21/21) | 59% (11/21) | **+41%** |
| **Avg Time** | 137.4s | 25.4s | +112s |
| **Avg Tokens** | 27,683 | 4,880 | +22,803 |

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Perfect correctness across all test scenarios
- ✅ Provides specific products, prices, and real customer data
- ✅ Handles budget conflicts with alternatives
- ⚠️ Takes 4-8x longer but provides actionable responses vs generic advice

## Comparison: Old vs New Approach

### Old Approach (claude_sdk_multiagent.py)
```python
# Custom implementation with manual sub-agent coordination
async def research_skill(...):
    # Custom research logic

async def analysis_skill(...):
    # Custom analysis logic

async def communication_skill(...):
    # Custom synthesis logic

# Manual orchestration in run()
research_result = await self.research_skill(...)
analysis_result = await self.analysis_skill(...)
final = await self.communication_skill(...)
```

**Issues**:
- ❌ Duplicates Claude's native capabilities
- ❌ Hard-coded phases (not flexible)
- ❌ More code to maintain

### New Approach (Skill-Based)
```python
# Uses existing claude_sdk_agent.py (no custom code)
# Skill lives in ~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-product-investigation/
# Claude automatically detects and invokes when appropriate
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Leverages Claude's native skill system
- ✅ Automatic triggering based on prompt
- ✅ Flexible - Claude decides when to use phases
- ✅ Less code, easier to maintain
- ✅ Reusable across different contexts

## Testing the Integration

### Quick Test

```bash
cd /Users/ukanagala/Desktop/uday/ai/conf/arena

# Start MCP server v2
python -m arena.mcp_server_v2

# In another terminal, run a test
python -c "
from arena.frameworks.claude_sdk_agent import ClaudeSDKAdapter
from arena.scenarios import SCENARIOS

adapter = ClaudeSDKAdapter(SCENARIOS['T5']['user_message'])
response = adapter.run_agent(SCENARIOS['T5']['user_message'])
print(response)
"
```

### Expected Behavior

You should see Claude:
1. Recognize the multi-faceted inquiry
2. Invoke the `multi-agent-product-investigation` skill
3. Use MCP tools to gather data (get_customer, get_orders, get_product_catalog, calculate_discount)
4. Provide a comprehensive response with:
   - Refund status for ORD-1234
   - Specific laptop/monitor/keyboard recommendations
   - YTD spending and discount eligibility
   - Complete pricing breakdown under $3000 budget
   - Clear next steps

## Skill Contents

```
multi-agent-product-investigation/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill definition
└── evals/
    └── evals.json             # Test cases with assertions
```

**Key sections in SKILL.md**:
- When to use (triggers on 2+ interrelated questions)
- Available MCP tools (8 tools from mcp_server_v2)
- Workflow approach (research → analysis → communication)
- Example workflows
- Edge case handling

---

## Maintenance

### Updating the Skill

If you need to improve the skill:

```bash
# Edit the skill
vim ~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-product-investigation/SKILL.md

# Test with skill-creator
claude # then run skill-creator to iterate

# No code changes needed in Arena benchmark
```

### Adding New Test Cases

```bash
# Edit evals
vim ~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-product-investigation/evals/evals.json

# Run evaluation
# (use skill-creator workflow)
```

---

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Skill logic separate from benchmark framework code
2. **Reusability**: Skill works in any Claude context (not just Arena)
3. **Maintainability**: Update skill without touching framework code
4. **Flexibility**: Claude decides when/how to use the skill based on prompt
5. **Natural Orchestration**: Claude handles multi-agent coordination natively
6. **Better Performance**: Leverages Claude's optimized skill system

---

## Next Steps

The integration is complete and ready to use!

**For running benchmarks**:
- Use existing scripts (no changes)
- Claude will automatically use the skill for T5

**For improving the skill**:
- Use skill-creator to iterate on the skill
- No Arena code changes needed

**For adding more scenarios**:
- Create new skills for new patterns
- Keep Arena framework code clean and simple

**Integration Type**: Skill-based (automatic)
**Framework Changes**: Minimal (just MCP server path)
