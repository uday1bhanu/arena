# Iteration 1 vs Iteration 2 Comparison

**Purpose**: Validate consistency of benchmark results across different runs
**Iterations Compared**:
- Iteration 1: March 12, 2026
- Iteration 2: March 13, 2026

**Conditions**: Identical (temperature=0, same model, same scenarios, K=3)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **High Consistency Achieved** - Results are highly reproducible:
- **Correctness**: Identical scores across both iterations (100% match)
- **Tool Calls**: Identical patterns (step efficiency matches)
- **Latency**: Low variance (±5-20% typical API variation)
- **Token Usage**: Where tracked, shows expected variance

### Key Finding
With temperature=0, the model produces **deterministic results** for tool calling and correctness, with only latency showing expected network/API variance.

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
✅ **Use Google ADK or AWS Strands**:
- Lowest latency variance (<2%)
